# Hello! üòäüëã

My name is Samantha (she/her), and I'm a student currently studying computer science. I'm passionate about fine arts and all sorts of things related to programming, including [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (free, open-source software), computer science, and software engineering. I think natural language processing is really interesting as well!

Previously, I've worked as a full-stack software engineer at ShoutWiki from January 2017 to July 2019.
