Hello! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹ My name is Samantha. I'm most interested in low-level programming including stuff like operating systems, assembly, compiler design. Other fields of interest include distributed engineering, and creating tools for improving the developer experience.

I host most of my JavaScript/TypeScript projects under the [nodecitylights organization](https://github.com/nodecitylights). Rust projects are hosted under my own personal account! ðŸ¦€
