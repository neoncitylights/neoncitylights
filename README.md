Hello! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹ My name is Samantha (she/her). I'm passionate about fine arts, linguistics, and all sorts of things related to programming, especially low-level code (like compiler design, operating systems, and programming languages). I also enjoy writing tooling to improve the overall developer experience.

I host (most) of my JavaScript/TypeScript projects under the GitHub [nodecitylights organization](https://github.com/nodecitylights) . Rust projects are hosted under my own personal account! ðŸ¦€
